Blood Donation Management System Database

The Blood Donation Management System database is designed to manage the collection, storage, and distribution of blood donations. This database will allow blood banks and donation centers to efficiently track donor information, blood type, donation history, and supply levels. The key objectives of this database are:

Donor Management

Store personal information about blood donors including name, contact details, blood type, and medical history.
Track donor eligibility and deferral status to ensure safe and compliant donations.
Maintain a comprehensive record of each donor's donation history, including donation date, location, and blood type collected.
Blood Inventory Management

Record the collection, processing, and storage of donated blood units.
Monitor blood supply levels by type and expiration date to ensure adequate stocks and minimize waste.
Facilitate the distribution of blood units to hospitals and medical facilities as needed.
Reporting and Analytics

Generate reports on donor demographics, donation trends, and blood supply statistics.
Analyze data to identify opportunities for improving donor recruitment and retention.
Support decision-making around blood drive planning, inventory management, and distribution.
